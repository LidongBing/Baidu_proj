This is a file to record the working precedure of the relation extraction pipeline.

#####2015 July 1#####
1. Preprocess webmd, see the folder: /remote/curtis/baidu/webmd-processed, its readme.txt, and run_pipeline.sh


#####2015 July 7#####
1. Run GPig to process "/remote/curtis/baidu/webmd-processed/webmd_export-2015-06-08T19-34-11_sent_code_parsed.txt" for coord lists and trivial lists ( or length 1+ lists)
	Code: webmd-processed/gpig/listmalt.py
	Run with: webmd-processed/gpig/run_listmalt.sh
	Output: ./gpig/gpig_views/listsWithItems.gp ./gpig/gpig_views/listsAsGraph.gp, ./gpig/gpig_views/listsWithDFeats.gp ./gpig/gpig_views/listWithCFeats.gp, ./gpig/gpig_views/readableLists.gp, 

	Conclusion: get 498867 lists
	

2. Generate trivial list and coord list tok features and bipartite graph by postprocessing the gpig output
	Code: webmd-processed/gpig/PostProcessGPig
	Run With: webmd-processed/gpig/run_PostProcessGPig.sh
	Output: webmd-processed/list-tok-feat/all-list/
	        webmd-processed/list-graph/



#####2015 July 10#####
1. Get the brand name, generic name, and section title for each unique sentence ID
	Code: java webmd.Preprocess.SentIDSecMapping webmd_export-2015-06-08T19-34-11_re_clean_ss_code.xml webmd_export-2015-06-08T19-34-11_sentId_info.txt
	Output: webmd_export-2015-06-08T19-34-11_sentId_info.txt

2. Get the list IDs in the form s_xx_yy from hasItem file of webmd.
	In folder /remote/curtis/baidu/webmd-processed/list-graph/
	Run: cat hasItem.cfacts | awk -F '\t' '{print $2}' > listID.txt



#####2015 July 11#####

#####1. NLM section detection and formatting result: /remote/curtis/baidu/mingyanl/0629/result/result2

2. Get a mapping from list ID to unique setence ID.
	Code: /remote/curtis/baidu/webmd-processed/webmd/Preprocess/mingyang/UniqIDMapping
	Run: java webmd.Preprocess.mingyang.UniqIDMapping webmd_export-2015-06-08T19-34-11_sent_code_parsed.txt list-graph/listID.txt listID_SentID_Map.txt

3. Augment the drug name (generic name first, if no exist, brand name) to the list item in the bipartite graph
	Code: /remote/curtis/baidu/webmd-processed/webmd/Preprocess/DrugAugmentGraph.java
	Run: java webmd.Preprocess.DrugAugmentGraph list-graph/hasItem.cfacts list-graph/inList.cfacts listID_SentID_Map.txt webmd_export-2015-06-08T19-34-11_sentId_info.txt list-graph/hasItem.cfacts.aug list-graph/inList.cfacts.aug
	Output: list-graph/hasItem.cfacts.aug list-graph/inList.cfacts.aug


4. Get hasFeature.cfacts and featureOf.cfacts files
	Code: /remote/curtis/baidu/webmd-processed/webmd/Preprocess/GraphFeature.java
	Run: java webmd.Preprocess.GraphFeature ./list-tok-feat/all-list/bow_context.tok_feat listID_SentID_Map.txt webmd_export-2015-06-08T19-34-11_sentId_info.txt list-graph/hasItem.cfacts.aug drug-item-feature/hasFeature.cfacts drug-item-feature/featureOf.cfacts
	Output: drug-item-feature/hasFeature.cfacts drug-item-feature/featureOf.cfacts


================================

For Mingyang

[share folder]
1 Get RelationSeed and Filter the multi-relation freebase seeds.
	Code: /remote/curtis/baidu/mingyanl/pipe_line/relationSeed/code/get_relation_with_name.sh /remote/curtis/baidu/mingyanl/0707/relationSeed/code/get_relation_with_name.sh 
	Run:1) bash get_relation_with_name.sh ("symptom_of" "condition_this_may_prevent"  "disease_or_condition_caused"  "symptom_of"  "used_to_treat")
	Run:2) bash sep_single_multi_relation.sh
	Output: /remote/curtis/baidu/mingyanl/pipe_line/relationSeed/seed_seperated/

2. Split seed for evalution and develop and generate seeds for 10 runs and different percentages
Split single-relation seeds into three parts, 50% for coverage testing, 10% for generating classification testing list with proppr, and 40% for  generating classification training list with proppr. 
Random different percentages of training seeds in each run [0-10]

	Code: HoldoutDevelop and PropprSeedForTrainTestList
	Run: bash /remote/curtis/baidu/mingyanl/pipe_line/single_runs/java_code_for_split_seed
	Output:/remote/curtis/baidu/mingyanl/pipe_line/single_runs/

3. Run SSL with proppr:
	InPut:	cfacts_files:featureOf.cfacts  hasFeature.cfacts  hasItem.cfacts  inList.cfacts (4 cfacts file)
			single_runs (all needed seeds file for 10 runs)
			ssl_LP.ppr(rule file)  
			testBoth.examples  test.examples  testList.examples (3 test file)
	Code: run_diff-runs.sh
	Run: . run_diff-runs.sh
	Output: diff-runs/

4. Generate example of length 1+ lists for classification with the solution of PROPPR, i.e. testList.solutions.txt

5. Generating the different types tok features of length 1+ lists

6. merge the tok feature files of length 1+ lists in ALL combination

7. Generate feature vectors of length 1+ lists  for the training files

8. Generate feature vectors of length 1+ lists  for the testing files


================================


		
2. Preprocess the NLM data data with section detected, in the same way as for webmd
	NLM data with section: /remote/curtis/baidu/mingyanl/0629/result
	see the folder: /remote/curtis/baidu/NLM-processed and its run_pipeline.sh
